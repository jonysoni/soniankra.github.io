		<h2>v6</h2>

			The first V6 prototype engine was produced in 1906, however it took until 1950 for the first automotive V6 engine to reach<br> production. In the past 20 to 30 years, the V6 layout has become the most common layout for six-cylinder automotive engines.<br>
			<h4>Design</h4>
			Due to their short length, V6 engines are often used as the larger engine option for vehicles which are otherwise produced with<br> inline-four engines, especially in transverse engine vehicles. A downside for luxury cars is that V6 engines produce more vibrations<br> than straight-six engines. Some sports cars use flat-six engines instead of V6 engines, due to their lower centre of gravity.<br>
			The displacement of modern V6 engines is typically between 2.5 to 3.5 L (153 to 214 cu in), though larger and smaller examples have<br> been produced, such as the 1.8 L (110 cu in) V6 engines used in the 1991-1998 Mazda MX3,[1] and the 1999-2005 Rover 45.<br>
			All V6 engines— regardless of the V-angle between the cylinder banks— are subject to a primary imbalance caused by each bank<br> consisting of an inline-three engine, due to the odd number of cylinders in each bank. Straight-six engines and flat-six<br> 
			engines do not experience this imbalance. To reduce the vibrations caused by this imbalance, some V6 engines use<br> 
			counterweights on the crankshaft and/or a counter-rotating balance shaft.<br><br>

			Six-cylinder designs have less pulsation in the power delivery than four-cylinder engines, due to the overlap in the power<br> 
			strokes of the six-cylinder engine. In a four-cylinder engine, only one piston is on a power stroke at any given time.<br>
			Each piston comes to a complete stop and reverses direction before the next one starts its power stroke, which results <br>
			in a gap between power strokes and annoying harshness, especially at lower engine speeds (RPM). In a six-cylinder engine <br>
			with an even firing interval, the next piston starts its power stroke 60° before the previous one finishes, which results <br>
			in smoother delivery of power to the flywheel.<br><br>

			Comparing engines on a dynamometer, a V6 engine shows instantaneous torque peaks of 150% above mean torque and valleys of <br>
			125% below mean torque, with a small amount of negative torque (engine torque reversals) between power strokes. <br>
			In the case of a four-cylinder engine, the peaks are nearly 300% above mean torque and valleys of 200% below mean torque, <br>
			with 100% negative torque being delivered between strokes. However, a V6 with an uneven firing interval shows large <br>
			torque variations of 200% above and 175% below mean torque.[2]<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
